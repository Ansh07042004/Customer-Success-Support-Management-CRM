# Customer-Success-Support-Management-CRM
A Salesforce solution to automate onboarding, support cases, and usage tracking for SaaS companies using Apex, LWC, and automation tools.

## ✅ Problem Statement

- Technology and SaaS companies often struggle to efficiently manage the entire customer lifecycle — from onboarding to support and renewals.  
Customer success teams need comprehensive visibility into onboarding progress, product usage, and support cases to proactively engage customers, reduce churn, and identify upsell opportunities.  

- However, data is frequently fragmented across multiple systems, and manual processes limit timely decision-making.  

**Project Goal**:  
To build an integrated Salesforce CRM platform that automates onboarding, tracks support cases, consolidates product usage data, and provides interactive dashboards for customer health monitoring.  
The solution empowers Customer Success Managers (CSMs) to enhance customer satisfaction, accelerate renewals, and drive revenue growth.

# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
# 1. Requirement Gathering
- Identify business goals: Improve customer retention, reduce churn, speed up onboarding, and enhance support responsiveness.

#Capture functional requirements:

- Centralize customer data (Accounts, Contacts)

- Manage onboarding (track tasks, status)

- Monitor support (log cases, SLAs)

- Analyze usage patterns (metrics from product)

- Generate renewal and upsell alerts

- Collect non-functional requirements: security, data privacy, mobile access, integration with support/product systems.

# Sample CRM requirements template elements:

- Data model: Custom & standard Salesforce objects for lifecycle tracking.

- Workflows: Automation for onboarding reminders, escalations, recurring tasks.

- Integration: Sync with external support/product tools.

- Reporting: Health dashboards, churn/renewal forecasts.

# 2. Stakeholder Analysis
- Stakeholder Identification: List internal (CSMs, Support, Sales, Executives) and external users (end customers).

- Role/Influence Mapping: Map stakeholder needs and influence:
  
- Executives: Strategic KPIs, dashboards

CSMs: Day-to-day customer health, onboarding

Support: Case management, priority queues.

Use stakeholder matrices (e.g., Power-Interest grid) to document involvement & needs.

Plan engagement: Meetings, workshops, feedback sessions for input on pain points and must-haves.

# 3. Business Process Mapping
Map SaaS customer lifecycle:

Awareness → Purchase → Onboarding → Support → Renewal/Upsell → Advocacy.

Illustrate current/desired workflows:

Onboarding: Automated task assignments, milestone tracking

Support: Case capture, escalation, resolution SLAs

Product Usage: Capture telemetry/events, flag risk/expansion

Visualize handoffs between teams (Sales→Onboarding→Support→Renewals).

# 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
Common SaaS use cases:

Predictive health scoring: Automatic assessment of churn risk or upsell potential

Automated onboarding: Task checklists, progress tracking

Support automation: Case routing, escalation, satisfaction surveys

Telemetry-driven engagement: Proactive support for under-engaged users

Examples:

AI tools for risk scoring (Gainsight, Totango)

Automated renewal workflows (ChurnZero, Planhat)

Self-service success/AI chatbots for support scale

# 5. AppExchange Exploration
Review AppExchange for:

Customer Success Management (Gainsight, Totango, ChurnZero)

Support Desk/Case Management (Zendesk, Service Cloud extensions)

Onboarding/onboarding checklist apps (TaskRay, Precursive)

Usage tracking (Adoption dashboards, telemetry connectors)

Assess fit with requirements and Salesforce compatibility.
