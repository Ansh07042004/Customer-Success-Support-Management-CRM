# Customer-Success-Support-Management-CRM
A Salesforce solution to automate onboarding, support cases, and usage tracking for SaaS companies using Apex, LWC, and automation tools.

## ✅ Problem Statement

Technology and SaaS companies often struggle to efficiently manage the entire customer lifecycle — from onboarding to support and renewals.  
Customer success teams need comprehensive visibility into onboarding progress, product usage, and support cases to proactively engage customers, reduce churn, and identify upsell opportunities.  

However, data is frequently fragmented across multiple systems, and manual processes limit timely decision-making.  

**Project Goal**:  
To build an integrated Salesforce CRM platform that automates onboarding, tracks support cases, consolidates product usage data, and provides interactive dashboards for customer health monitoring.  
The solution empowers Customer Success Managers (CSMs) to enhance customer satisfaction, accelerate renewals, and drive revenue growth.
